        <p><b>I like to code because it helps me learn something new all the time.It is a good habbit and if I can do it then everyone can too.I think coding is pretty simple.It has a few main parts.The parts I learnt are HTML, CSS and Java script.I think all of then are easy to learn.<br><br>Whenever I go to home from school, I like to do coding after finishing all my homeworks.It makes me happy and busy. It is a good source of enjoyment,knowledge, Inspiration.Now I am 10 years old and studying in 5th grade and It makes me and all the other people who code a successful person.</b></p>
